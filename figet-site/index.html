    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate designer and 3D printing enthusiast who loves exploring the possibilities of form, function, and fabrication. Each piece you see on this page reflects my journey through creativity, experimentation, and learning in the world of digital design and additive manufacturing. I started this business to help all of my friends at school who would not pay attention in class because they were always in search of the perfect fidget. I think that today I have at least made one. Thank you for your time and I hope you love these fidgets with many more coming soon.</p>

    <p>This figet is meant truly for the gamers all of the people that love the feel of a joystick flinging back and forth in their hands.</p>

    <h2>Two Face Button</h2>
    <p>let me just push this little guy down, okay now the next, okay now the next, what, ahhhh. The normal madness of a springy button times two this figet fuctions by a gear that allows a button to come up when the other goes down.</p>

    <h2>Twister</h2>
    <p>In my opinion one of the best creations of the 20th century a small twisty tower that contains a square peice that slides doen in a spiral when it is flipped upside down.</p>
